# Flappy Clone 🐦

This is my first Unity project where I recreated the classic **Flappy Bird** game using **C#** and **Unity**.  
The goal of this project was to learn game development basics such as player input, collision detection, scoring, and UI management.  

## 🎮 Features
- Player controls a bird that moves by tapping/clicking.
- Pipes spawn at random heights for the player to avoid.
- Score increases each time the player passes through pipes.
- Game Over screen with restart button.
- High Score is saved using Unity's PlayerPrefs system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Unity** (C# scripting)
- **TextMeshPro** for UI
- **AudioSource** for sound effects

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FlappyClone.git
